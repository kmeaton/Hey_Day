# Auburn University's Hey Day!

Each year, students, faculty, and staff at Auburn University come together as a community to showcase their school spirit and greet one another as a family. This event, in which name tags are given out across campus to members of the Auburn community, promotes a feeling of togetherness and campus pride. By handing out name tags, we encourage our fellow students, faculty, and staff to say "Hey!" and offer a friendly greeting. Though this year's Hey Day may look a bit different due to the global pandemic, we can still say "Hey!" virtually. More information about Auburn's Hey Day tradition is available [here](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/).

The script included in this repository (Eaton_Hey_Day.sh) prompts the user to enter their name, and then greets them with a friendly hello once they've stated their name.
